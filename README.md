The files which are not know by git and like you have made a new file and it is not known by git 

Another type of files are modified files that have been changed

Another type is staged this happens when the file is ready to be commited and it is staged like ki do step hai 
pahle add karna padta hai fir commit hota hai to ye bich vaala add hi staged hota hai

commit karne ke baad file unchanged ho jaati hai

add - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.
git add <- file name ->


When we have to do many changes we can do git add . 

commit - it is the record of change
git commit -m "some message"

Push Command
push - upload local repo content to remote repo
git push origin main

ABHI JO BHI HUMNE COMMIT KIYA HAI VO LOCALLY IS COMPUTER PE SAVE HOGAYA HAI LEKIN GITHUB PE 
ABHI NAHI SHOW HOGA TO VAHAN SHOW KARNE KE LIYE PUSH COMMAND 

JAISE "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 comit." YE LIKH KE AYEGA TERMINAL ME

ISKA MATLAB KI HUM EK COMMIT AAGE HAI GITHUB SE
